        "2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "  - 1. Linearity\n",
        "\n",
        "     There should be a linear relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y).\n",
        "     The change in Y is proportional to the change in X.\n",
        "     Nonlinear relationships violate this assumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Example: If studying more hours consistently increases marks, the relationship is linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - 2. Independence of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "     The residuals (errors) ‚Äî the differences between actual and predicted values ‚Äî must be independent of each other.\n",
        "     This means one observation‚Äôs error should not depend on another‚Äôs.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Example: In time-series data, errors from one day should not affect the next day.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - 3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance)\n",
        "     The variance of the residuals should be constant across all values of X.\n",
        "     Equal spread of errors throughout the data.\n",
        "     If errors increase or decrease as X increases, it‚Äôs called heteroscedasticity.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Example: The spread of exam score errors should be similar for all study hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - 4. Normality of Errors\n",
        "     The residuals should be normally distributed (bell-shaped curve).\n",
        "     Important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
        "     You can check this by plotting a histogram or Q-Q plot of residuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - 5. No or Minimal Multicollinearity\n",
        "     Since SLR has only one independent variable, this assumption mainly applies to multiple regression ‚Äî but in general, X should not be highly correlated with other predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - 6. No Measurement Error in X\n",
        "     The independent variable (X) should be measured accurately ‚Äî errors in X can bias the results."
